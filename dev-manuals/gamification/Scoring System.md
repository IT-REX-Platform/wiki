# Scoring System
## 2 System Approach
An idea is to have two score systems: a longterm scoring system and a shortterm scoring system.
The longterm system is based on the 4 skill levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyse) and is static, meaning the points decrease by themself. Only through human errors or the usage of hints or other to be determined ways.
The shortterm system is based on the progress through the course material (videos, lecture slides, etc.), the repetition of those and the appearance of new material. Meaning, the score decreases if you do not repeat the lecture, if you neglect new material and the score decreases faster with the passage of time.

### Shortterm System
For the shortterm system the decrease of points should happen slow in the beginning (2 or 3 points on the first day) and decrease faster with each passing day (with the 2 point start it continues: 4, 8, 16, 32,...). It has to be determined, if the effect should be cumulative or not. 
It has to be mentioned that the former progress should not be decreased completly, but only to a certain limit.

### Longterm System
This score should be calculated by combining the 4 different skills together. A skill test has to be done multiple times (depending on the size of the chapter content, 2-5 times) to achive full points in the chapter. 
If you use hints, the progress points could be halved for the question where it was used.
The score for wrong answers decreases in the beginning slowly (1 point), but it creeps up fast (2, 4, 8, 16). It has to be considerd that the score can never go below 0 for one test.
Should a test come up multiple times in one run, the score should slowly.
