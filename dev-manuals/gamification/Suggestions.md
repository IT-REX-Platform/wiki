# Suggestions
## What are they for?
The suggestion system is a way for the student to now what should be worked on next. It gives the student the hint which course should be exerciesed next. But it is only a hint or a nudge for the students. It does not determine what he can or can not do.
For example, if a student has 2 courses where he should repeat the flashcard, the suggestion system should nudge the student to do the flashcards that he neglected the longest.
## How do they work?
As you seen above, in the example, the suggestion takes time into account to determine, which media or which course it suggests. But that does not have to be the only variable. Another factor can be the points that are awarded by completing an assignment or the progress for a skill level by finishing a task.
Factors that impact the suggestion score:
- time that passed since a media is released, that has not been viewed yet
- time that passed since an assignment should have been repeated
- the points that can be gained by completing a suggested item
- the improvement to a skill level that might be achived by completing a suggested item flawlessly

If the score should be the same for 2 or more items, a destinction by preference might be implemented.
For example, if a student has the same work to do for 2 courses and the scores between both scores for the courses are the same, than the course that has been marked as *favored* is suggested first.
