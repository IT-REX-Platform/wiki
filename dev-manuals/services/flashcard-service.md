# Flashcard service

This service enables repetitive learning and ensures that students keep their acquired knowledge through a course.
The flashcards should be like physical flashcards.
On one side of the card is content (text, image, video) with a question regarding content the student already worked on. 
These questions are manually created by the lecturer (later automatic generation if possible).
On the other side of the card should be the answer to that flashcard, where students can check whether they knew the answer or not.
After reading the answer to that question, the students can swipe the card respective to if they did know it correctly or not.
If they knew the right answer, the flashcard will not be shown soon after.
If they didnâ€™t know the correct answer, the flashcard will come up soon again to check if the student improved and learned the respective content.
