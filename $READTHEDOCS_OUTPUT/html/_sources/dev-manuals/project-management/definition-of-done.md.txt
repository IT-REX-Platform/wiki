# Definition of Done

These are the points the team has agreed on during the lift-off meeting:

- no commits to the main branch, always open a pull-request (PR) according to the PR template:
    - short description + issue
    - how to test the feature
    - acceptance criteria (DoD)
    - issue specific acceptance criteria
- PR needs to be reviewed by someone working on a similar part of the project (backend / frontend)
- PR is approved by PO after successfull review
- tests are passing
- sufficient test coverage
- documentation is updated
- how to test the feature manually is documented
- changes were communicated to the team and updated on the issue board
