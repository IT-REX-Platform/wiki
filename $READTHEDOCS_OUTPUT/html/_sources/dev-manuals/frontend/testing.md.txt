# Frontend testing

The frontend will mainly be tested manually.
In order for everyone to perform those tests a test plan is added for each feature that describes how a functionality can be tested and what to expect as a result.  
In addition acceptance tests need to be performed whenever there is an important new feature.  
Whenever it is possible and useful unit tests should be added as well.
