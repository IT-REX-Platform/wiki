# Databases

## Only SQL, no no SQL

There is not really a need for a no SQL database and some team members already know SQL.
For now only SQL databases will be used.


## Postgres

Discussed options are Mysql and Postgres, both should be fine and it should also be possible to change them later.
The basic functionality is the same for both, it really shouldn't make a difference.
The team had a preference for Postgres and decided on using that.


## MinIO blob storage for media content

There is a need to store media content in a blob storage.
MinIO is open source and was proposed by the project customers / owners and the team doesn't know about any better competitor.
