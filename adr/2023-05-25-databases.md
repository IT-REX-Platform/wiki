# Databases

## Only SQL, no no SQL

There is not really a need for a no SQL database and some team members already know SQL.
For now only SQL databases will be used.


## Postgres

Discussed options are Mysql and Postgres, both should be fine and it should also be possible to change them later.
The basic functionality is the same for both, it really shouldn't make a difference.
The team had a preference for Postgres and decided on using that.
